# Word-Classification-Using-RNN-Through-MFCC
This project performs word classification using RNN with Bidirectional LSTM and MFCC features from audio data. It trains, evaluates, and visualizes model performance with accuracy, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. Developed using TensorFlow, Librosa, and scikit-learn.
